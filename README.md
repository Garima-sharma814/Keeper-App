# Keeper-App

Google-Keeper Clone made with React.

## How to install?

Assuming you have already installed `nodejs` and `npm` (Node.js package manager) and `create-React-app` generator. If not goto [React Installation](#use-react-in-vs-code) or [React Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial).

> **Tip**: To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type `node --version` and `npm --version` in a terminal or command prompt.

### Step 1
```
npm i 
```
or 
```
npm install 
```

### Step 2

```
npm start
```


## Use React in VS-Code

### Step 1
You can now create a new React application by typing:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

- my-app is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the React application and install its dependencies.

### Step 2

Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

```
cd my-app
```
```
npm start
```

### Step 3

> To open your React application in VS Code, open another terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the my-app folder and type code .:

```
cd my-app
```

```
code .
```
